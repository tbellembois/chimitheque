# Chimithèque

Chimithèque is an open source chemical product management application initially developped by the ENS-Lyon (France).

The project has started in 2015 and has moved to Github in 2017.
The old subversion repository can be found here: <https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/viewvc.php?root=chimitheque>

Why Chimithèque?  
We needed a global method to manage chemical products of the different departments and laboratories of the ENS to:
- improve the security with a precise global listing of the chemicals products stored in the entire school
- reduce waste by encouraging chemical products managers to search in Chimithèque if a product can be borrowed from another department before ordering a new one
